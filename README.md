# From-Infix-notation-to-Postfix-notation
This code allows you to enter your equation into infix notation to transform this into postfix notation and calculate the result.
The code presents some bugs that I would like to improve. I would like to ask anyone who wants to help me with these problems:

1) When I go to sum up or multiply numbers greater than 9, the result is not right.

2) Increase the possibility of adding the calculation gonimetria and powers.

If you notice other bugs let me know.
