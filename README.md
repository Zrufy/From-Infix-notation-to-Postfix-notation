# From-Infix-notation-to-Postfix-notation
This code allows you to enter your equation into infix notation to transform this into postfix notation and calculate the result.
The code presents some bugs that I would like to improve. I would like to ask anyone who wants to help me with these problems:

1) ~When I go to sum up or multiply numbers greater than 9, the result is not right.~ ( RESOLVED )

2) Increase the possibility of adding the calculation gonimetria and powers.

3) Work with float,double number.


If you notice other bugs let me know.
